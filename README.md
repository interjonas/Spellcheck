# Spellcheck
This project was completed in a group setting and followed all guidlines required by the project description. The fuction of this program was for it to learn new words over time based on user preferences and selections. The user inputs a list of words as a text file into the program GUI. The program then runs each word on the list against a database of words, and determines which word is misspelt by checking if the word is existent in the current database. The program ignores case sensitivity, whitespace, and contractions. The program will then compile a new list of all the misspelt words orignially entered. The user will then be presented with a simple paneled window. The GUI will then display to the user all the misspelt words and which words the user wants to be saved in the dictionary as "Learned" so that the program will not flag it in the future. The user can seamlessly choose which words to add to the dictionary and all of this is efficently added and searched using a binary search tree. Then after the user selects which words to add, they press continue and are given an option to download two lists. The first list is of the words that were not added and will continue to be flagged. While the second file is a list of all the newly added words. The program can be contstantly reused so that the program's dictionary learns newer words with every iterative use.
